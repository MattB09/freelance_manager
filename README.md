# freelance_manager
A web app for managing your freelance work. Create projects for given clients. Under each project, you can create tasks and record the time you spend for each task. Click a button to start and stop recording. Set a task as billable or unbillable to keep track of non-billable work as well such as time spent to learn a new skill for the sake of the project. 

Use Freelance Manager to make sure you are charging your clients fairly and not selling yourself short by having to estimate (which usually means underestimating) how much time you actually spent. 

Version two of the app will involve generating invoices for the work completed in a given period, based on an hourly rate you determine with each client for each project.
